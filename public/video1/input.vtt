00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
 - Yes, but... but what a scandal. - You may go now.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.580
 - But... - You may go.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.720
 - Well, tell me, why are you staring at my nose? - Oh, I was not staring.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.180
 - Does that astonish you? - Why, no, I've been careful not to look.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.260
 - Oh, and why not, if you please? It disgusts you, then. - But, no, I don't...

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.760
 - Does its color appear to you unwholesome? - By no means.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.260
 - And possibly you find it just a trifle large? - No, small, very small, tiny, infinitesimal.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.300
 - What? You accuse me of absurdity? Small my nose? Why, magnificent my nose!

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.300
 As you pug, you knob, you buttonhead, know that I glory in this nose of mine.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:46.280
 For a great nose indicates a great man. Genial, courteous, intellectual, virile, courageous.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.280
 Whilst that face of yours, that blank, inglorious concavity...

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.860
 ...which my right hand finds on top of you, is as devoid of pride, of poetry, of soul...

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.260
 ...of picturesqueness, of contour, of character, of nose, in short...

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.240
 ...as that which at the bottom of that limp spine of yours my left foot...

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.580
 - Oh, hell a farce! - Presently, this fellow will grow tiresome.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.880
 - Oh, he blows his horn. - Well, will no one put him in his place?

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.780
 If you will allow me. Observe.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:32.600
 Monsieur, your nose, your nose is rather large.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.100
 - Rather? - Oh, well.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.100
 - Is that all? - Well, of course, if you...

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 Ah, no, young sir, you're too simple. Why, you might have said a great many things.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.100
 Why waste your opportunity? For example, thus, aggressive.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.220
 I swear if that nose were mine, I'd have it amputated on the spot.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.220
 Practical. How do you drink with such a nose?

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.320
 You must have had a cup made especially. Descriptive. 'Tis a rock.
